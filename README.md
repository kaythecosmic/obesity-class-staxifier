# **Obesity Level Prediction System**

## Overview

Obesity is a significant health concern globally, driven by sedentary lifestyles and poor dietary habits. To address this issue, a technology-based solution in the form of an Obesity Level Prediction System has been developed. This system utilizes an ensemble learning approach known as "Staxifier" to predict obesity levels across seven distinct categories. The aim is to leverage machine learning to combat obesity and its associated health risks.

## Methodology

The Obesity Level Prediction System employs a stacking approach with multiple classifiers, combining diverse base classifiers into a meta-classifier. This ensemble learning method enhances prediction accuracy by aggregating predictions from multiple models.

## Results

The Staxifier model achieved impressive performance metrics:

- **Accuracy:** 0.9905
- **Precision:** 0.991
- **Recall:** 0.9901

These high scores indicate the effectiveness of the prediction system in accurately classifying obesity levels.
